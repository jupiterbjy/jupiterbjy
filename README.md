## About this weirdo

Hobby Pythonist who mainly uses _Python 3.11_.

Also loves hobby drawing & modeling, and using 3D printers!

- Prefer `trio` over `threading` and `asyncio`. Personally I think all pythonist should read [this](https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/) multiple times.
- Strong preference to Jetbrains IDE family
