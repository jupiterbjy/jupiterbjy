## About this weirdo

Hobby Pythonist who mainly uses _Python 3.12_ and up.

Also loves hobby drawing & modeling, and using 3D printers!

loves doing various hobbies:
- (Attempt of) Following the teachings of *The Zen of Python*
- Simple Drawing(more like scribbling)
- Programming Random stuffs
- Very basic Modeling
- 3D Printing
- Using Godot Game engine
- Existing in Steam
- Falling in love to [nonexistent being](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/123330372)

And preferences of:
- Readability, Documentation, Comments *ABSOL-FCKIN-LUTELY* counts
- Prefer `black` formatting
- Prefer `trio` over `threading` & `asyncio`. Personally I think all pythonist should read [this](https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/) multiple times.
- Strong preference to Jetbrains IDE family

## Some lang preference

| Lang | Note |
|-|-|
|Python|Loves EAFP, Loves Zen of Python, love PEP8|
|C++|Does not like fighting with implicit hell & Rule of 0/3/5 but will still do it|
|C|Will do if gun's pointed at me|
|C#|Only extremely limited Unity usage, Will do if gun's pointed at me|
|Javascript|Loves to go pure CSS/JS/HTML and suffer, or mix with Brython and wait 10 second load time like true weirdo|
|Java|Will do if gun's pointed at me|
|SPARC|Won't do even if gun's pointed at me(hopefully)|
|GDScript|A language that didn't quite become any of language I love but still uses with love-hate attitude|

<!--
ETC:
- can do basic Gitlab CE setup & management
- can do basic Gitlab Pipeline setup (despite I don't use it myself)

## Zen of Python

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
