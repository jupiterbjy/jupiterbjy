### About me

Hobby Pythonist who mainly uses _Python 3.8/3.9_.

- code style: `black` & `pylint`
- Prefer `trio` over `threading` and `asyncio`. Personally I think all pythonist should read [this](https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/) multiple times.
- Extremely strong preference to Jetbrains IDE family

Happens to draw [minor things](https://steamcommunity.com/id/jupiterbjy/images/) time to time.
