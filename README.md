## About this weirdo

Hobby Pythonist who mainly uses _Python 3.9/3.10_.

- code style: `black`
- Prefer `trio` over `threading` and `asyncio`. Personally I think all pythonist should read [this](https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/) multiple times.
- Extremely strong preference to Jetbrains IDE family
