## About this weirdo

<img height="200" alt="maneki_bw_neko" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bba1367-eefa-4f99-accb-55a4ad4bc6f1" />

Manekineko wishing everyone fortune, hobby Pythonist living by _"Zen of Python"_.

<br>

Also loves tons of various hobbies:
- Programming Random stuffs for random life/hobby problems
- Simple scribbling
- Very basic blender Modeling
- 3D Printing
- Wishing happiness to [nonexistent beings](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/123330372)

And preferences of:
- Readability, Documentation, Comments *ABSOL-FCKIN-LUTELY* counts
- Prefer `black` formatting
- Prefer `trio` over `threading` & `asyncio`. Personally I think all pythonist should read [this](https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/) multiple times.
- Strong preference to Jetbrains IDE family, not sure I like recent changes tho...

<br>

## Some lang preference

| Lang | Note |
|-|-|
|Python|Loves EAFP, Loves Zen of Python, love PEP8|
|C++|Does not like fighting with implicit hell & Rule of 0/3/5 but will still do it|
|C|Will do if gun's pointed at me|
|C#|Only extremely limited usage, Will do if gun's pointed at me|
|Javascript|Loves to go pure CSS/JS/HTML & suffer, or mix with Brython like weirdo|
|Java|Will do if gun's pointed at me|
|SPARC|Won't do even if gun's pointed at me(hopefully)|
|GDScript|Enjoy using with love-hate attitude|

## Zen of Python

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
